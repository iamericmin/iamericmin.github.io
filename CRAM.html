              <h1>◀ MOTIVATION ▶</h1>
              It was the summer of '24, and I had just finished up my first year of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. I had a lot of time left rolling around, as unlike most of my friends, I wasn't able to score a summer internship. So, I did what I always do best: I made my own. I went to LinkedIn, created a business page, and hired myself as a Min Works Hardware Design summer intern. After announcing my fortunate opportunity, I immediately got to work.
              <br><br>
              This wasn't going be just another hobby project. It would be a demonstration of all the knowledge and skills I've acquired over the years as a hobbyist and engineering student. I wanted to incorporate all the different domains of ECE I was interested in, such as power supply design, digital systems, and signal processing. It didn't take long to come up with something: I set out to design an automotive data acquisition system for high-speed processing and transmission of data through CAN.

                Before I start, I would be fully transparent and clarify that THIS DESIGN IS NOT FULLY WORKING!!! The ICE40UP5K FPGA is not working as of right now (8/27/2024), but I've checked the schematic and checked voltages countless times with no faults yet to be found, so I'm still confident I will be able to get it running someday. My school schedule's quickly picking up and soon I'll have no time for any hobby work, which is why I'm writing this write-up now.

                <h1>◀ DESIGN ▶</h1>
                I started jotting down ideas around three weeks before my spring semester ended. Even before I wrote anything down, three things were for sure:
                <br><br>
                1. It was going to incorporate an FPGA.<br>
                2. It was going to have a proper power supply.<br>
                3. It was going to be an exercise in mixed-signal PCB design, and I was going to make it as precise and as accurate as possible.
                <br><br>
                New goals and objectives developed constantly during the process of board design and layout. Later, I started implementing my own custom communication interface between the FPGA and STM32, as well as designing a more robust PSU than planned to meet certain automotive ISO standards.
                <br><br>
                Unlike Time Machine Mk. 8, the design was a pretty straightforward process once I had all major component choices and placements locked in. While I often found myself re-routing a section or moving parts around, the design as a whole didn't really change much from my initial concept sketch to the final product.

                <h2>SYSTEM OVERVIEW</h2>

                  Here is a simple block diagram of how this system is intended to operate. Analog and digital signals are read by the system via the quad ADC's SMA inputs, or by the exposed digital payload connectors. That information is processed by the STM32 and/or the FPGA, and is transmitted back out of the system via USB, CAN, or any of the digital interfaces exposed on the payload connectors.
                <h2>STM32H743VGT6</h2>
                  The main brains of this project is an STM32H743, specifically one offered in a 100-LQFP package. I chose this simply as it had a lot of processing power while still being a hand-solderable package.
