              <h1>◀ RATIONALE ▶</h1>
              It was the summer of '24, and I had just finished up my first year of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. I had a lot of time left rolling around, as unlike most of my friends, I wasn't able to score a summer internship. So, I did what I always do best: I made my own. I went to LinkedIn, created a business page, and hired myself as a Min Works Hardware Design summer intern. After announcing my fortunate opportunity, I immediately got to work.
              <br><br>
              This wasn't going be just another hobby project. It would be a demonstration of all the knowledge and skills I've acquired over the years as a hobbyist and engineering student. I wanted to incorporate all the different domains of ECE I was interested in, such as power supply design, digital systems, and signal processing. It didn't take long to come up with something: I set out to design an automotive data acquisition system for high-speed processing and transmission of data through CAN.

                Before I start, I would be fully transparent and clarify that THIS DESIGN IS NOT FULLY WORKING!!! The ICE40UP5K FPGA is not working as of right now (8/27/2024), but I've checked the schematic and checked voltages countless times with no faults yet to be found, so I'm still confident I will be able to get it running someday. My school schedule's quickly picking up and soon I'll have no time for any hobby work, which is why I'm writing this write-up now.
