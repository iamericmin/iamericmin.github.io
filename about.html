                <p>ABOUT ME...</p>
                <a>
                    Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody told you it was a happy little tale, if somebody told you I was just your average ordinary guy, not a care in the world... somebody lied. To truly understand who I am, imagine these three people...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1) A ranking scholar, always at the top of his class and eager to go to shool every day
                    <br>
                    2) A skilled athelete in peak physical condition, showing great sportsmanship in every game he plays
                    <br>
                    3) A sweet, caring son who always tries the absolute best to make his parents proud
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Got it? Good. Now combine all three.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm the opposite of that. I'm a skinny Asian boy who can't even down a can of Red Bull without suffering a mild panic attack. But hey, I have a theoretical degree in quantum physics. You know what I also have? A burning passion for computers and engineering. Here, I occasionally post articles on my engineering endeavors. I mainly deal with microcontrollers and firmware development, but here and there I branch out and try new things as well. Oh hey, I forgot to introduce myself. I guess I was lost in the heat of passion. Haha.

                    I'm Eric Min, if you couldn't tell from the giant glowy neon banner. I was born in Seoul, South Korea but I live in the US. At the time of writing, I'm a senior at high school. Fun times. Besides making electronics, my other interests lie in... well, whatever kids my age are into! Movies, books, video games, you know. My personality type is ENTP. I enjoy arguing and discussing about things I love. I frequently get lost in my own thoughts and come up with creative ideas in the weirdest of times. I like to throw quips and joke around. I do what I want because I can.
                    <br><br>
                    Ready to see who I am? Scroll down if you hate yourself.
