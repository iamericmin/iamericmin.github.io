                My love for engineering gets me up in the morning and keeps me up at night. I've been designing and manufacturing my own electronics since I was 16, and my extensive experience in hardware design gives me strong confidence and intuition across the entire product development cycle, from initial napkin sketch to testing to manufacturing a physical product.
                <br><br>
                <a style="font-weight: bold;">
                I strongly believe that great products come from the heart, not the brain. Truly great engineering isn't a product of science; they're love letters. It is with this attitude I tackle my work with, and my sheer focus and borderline psychotic attention to detail assures that no task is finished until every pixel on my screen is exactly where I want it to be.

                <a style="font-weight: bold;">
                As a human, I rely on my confidence and strong faith in myself to figure out problems, both new and familiar. I often take time to reflect on myself, and I am my harshest critic while also being my loudest cheerleader. My ability to be my own hype man allows me to find motivation and inspiration everywhere in life, and this mix of brutal reflection and fierce resilience is what I consider my greatest strength.

                My dream as an engineer is to design consumer products such as laptops or game consoles.

                My ultimate goal in life is to go on a trip to the great plains in a Dodge Viper, sit on the roof, and watch the sun set.
