                <p>ABOUT ME...</p>
                <a>
                    Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody told you it was a happy little tale, if somebody told you I was just your average ordinary guy, not a care in the world... somebody lied. To truly understand who I am, imagine these three people...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1) A ranking scholar, always at the top of his class and eager to go to shool every day
                    <br>
                    2) A skilled athelete in peak physical condition, showing great sportsmanship in every game he plays
                    <br>
                    3) A sweet, caring son who always tries the absolute best to make his parents proud
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Got it? Good. Now combine all three.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm the opposite of that. I'm a skinny Asian boy who can't even down a can of Red Bull without suffering a mild panic attack. But hey, I have a theoretical degree in quantum physics. You know what I also have? A burning passion for electronics and cars. Here, I occasionally post articles on my engineering endeavors. I mainly deal with microcontrollers and firmware development, but here and there I branch out and try new things as well. Oh hey, I forgot to introduce myself. I guess I was lost in the heat of passion. Haha.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm Eric Min. I was born in Seoul, South Korea but I live in the US. At the time of writing, I'm a sophomore at Purdue University.. Fun times. Besides making electronics, my other hobbies include watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, working out, or playing Forza Horizon 4. My personality type is ENTP. I enjoy arguing and discussing about things I love. I frequently get lost in my own thoughts and come up with creative ideas in the weirdest of times. I like to throw quips and joke around. I do what I want because I can.
                    <br><br>
                    Ready to see who I am? Scroll down if you hate yourself.

                        Here are some fun facts about me!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1) I'm a huge fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion.
                        <br>
                        2) My favorite song is the NGE cover of Fly Me to the Moon.
                        <br>
                        3) My affordable dream car is a 2016 Camaro SS 1le. My "unobtainable" dream cars are the Lexus LFA, R34 GT-R, RS200, and 993 Turbo S.
