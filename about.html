                My love for engineering gets me up in the morning and keeps me up at night. I've been designing and manufacturing my own electronics since I was 16, and the fire that is my passion for the subject still burns so intense it would shame a Raptor engine at full throttle.

                As an embedded engineer, I strongly believe that great hardware makes great software. My sheer focus and borderline psychotic attention to detail assures that no task is finished until every pixel on my screen is exactly where I want it to be.

                As a human, I find immense joy discovering the delicate nuances in everything life has to offer. I strive to listen to every beat, savor every bite, and feel every moment. I love being able to understand things down to their very core and understand the fundamental forces that make it tick. I truly believe that the greatest joys in life lie at the very edge, revealed only to those who put in their best effort to go beyond their limits.

                My main interests lie in power electronics, signal processing, FPGA/MCU development, and PCB design. Besides designing electronics, I enjoy car spotting, singing in the shower, and listening to Daft Punk. My dream is to either work in ASIC design, or electronic control systems for automotive/motorsport applications.

                My ultimate goal in life is to go on a trip to the great plains in a Dodge Viper, sit on the roof, and watch the sun set.
