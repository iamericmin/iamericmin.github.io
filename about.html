              I love asking other people what they like to do for fun. I think it’s a great question that gives good insight into what kind of person I’m talking to. Unfortunately, the most common answer I hear is “I don’t know”, or some popular generic hobby, such as working out or listening to music. I mean, who doesn’t like listening to music? It seems to most people, my favorite question is just as boring as any other cheesy icebreaker.

              For me, however, nothing makes me happier than when someone asks what my hobby is. On the rare occasion I get asked, I always reply, “I make my own electronics” and try my best to steer the conversation to my various homemade electronics, which could then end in two possible ways: either the person asking has lost all interest and is cooking up an excuse to leave the conversation, or they are just like me and love hearing about other people’s hobbies. And on the <i>very</i> rare occasion the latter happens, I feel like I hit the jackpot.

              Ever since I was a skinny young boy, engineering has been what got me up in the morning and kept me up and night. It all started when I first watched Iron Man 2 in fifth grade. I loved watching Tony Stark fight bad guys with his red and gold armor, but what really interested me were the scenes where he was in his giant lab, building prototypes and working out problems. I realized one day that if I was smart enough and had enough money, I could theoretically build a real-life Iron Man suit. I had a wild imagination as a kid, and the endless possibilities of engineering constantly buzzed me with excitement. My imagination and excitement still burns bright to this day. So, on the <i>extremely</i> rare occasion someone asks me why I love engineering, I always answer: “Because if I am smart enough, I can build my own Iron Man suit!”

              Sadly, to build an Iron Man suit, you need not only brains, but money as well. The power and importance of money only rises with each day, and I would be lying if I said money wasn’t a big reason for why I want to pursue engineering. Technology develops at an astonishing pace, which means that the money that follows it also grows. Engineering has permeated our daily lives past the point where people no longer actively realize it. ECE is an excellent example; there are computers in our thermostats, watches, toothbrushes, even rings! As an ECE major, I’m confident there will always be growing demand for my skills, a privilege not available to all. I consider myself an extremely motivated and passionate individual, so I have a lot of items to check off on my bucket list, many of which would cost a fortune to achieve. While money is not really my main reason for pursuing engineering, it’s certainly an excellent perk that comes along with it that motivates me even more. Besides winning the lottery, I believe becoming a skilled engineer is the quickest way to achieve my dreams. Plus, your chances of being murdered by a family member stays exactly the same regardless!

              Just like how technology affects every part of our lives, ECE holds a significant part in mine as well. My latest electronic gizmo is a digital watch. I call it Time Machine, and as it’s in its eighth iteration, it’s designated Time Machine Mk. 8. I built it completely from scratch, from a napkin sketch to a working prototype. The process was long and hard; I had to teach myself new concepts and look through hundreds of pages of datasheets online, trying to cram everything I wanted into a tiny circuit board no wider than my thumb. The entire process took me around half a year and unhealthy amounts of black coffee. As boring as it may sound to most people, making electronics is my favorite thing to do in this world. Watching my creations come to life gives me such immense happiness and joy, feelings I think could only be compared to when one sees their child in the backyard blowing bubbles. I’ve been wearing Time Machine Mk. 8 every day since its creation and take care of it like it’s my son, because looking at it makes me so incredibly proud of myself and fills me up with joy. It’s my own little reminder of what I am capable of if I give something my all. My major and my hobby constantly motivates and challenges me to do my best not just in school, but also in life.

              To be honest, I don’t always love my major. There are countless occasions where I’m discouraged by my intense coursework or feel like an imposter among much smarter peers who seem to have their life together. But it’s my undying passion and love for what I do that makes ECE so incredibly special to me. As intimidating ECE can be sometimes, I try not to let these thoughts get the best of me, because I know as long as I give it my all, just like I did so with creating Time Machine Mk. 8, everything will be alright.
