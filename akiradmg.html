                During the summer of 2019, my family and I went on a short two-day trip to Akihabara, Japan. I was lucky enough to visit Super Potato, a local retro gaming store. There, I bought a red Play it Loud edition DMG gameboy. Inspired by Kaneda's bike from Akira, I decided to turn it into a custom DMG with custom coloring and a backlit/biverted screen. This was my first ever gameboy mod so I didn't bother to document my process. Overall, it took me over two hours.

                Red is one of my favorite colors and I think it looks dope on my console. The black and white buttons are the icing on the cake. Of course, my favorite part is the green backlight and biverted screen. It is crispy and clear while also being easy on the eyes. The photo doesn't do it justice, it looks amazing in real life. The green color goes well with the red shell and the entire console oozes Akira vibes, just like how I wanted it to be!
