            <p> HACKERS, A TEXT-BASED GAME</p>
            <a>
                It is the 80's. The synth is wavy. Michael Jackson is still black. Thankfully, things are not like how Orwell anticipated. Life is actually pretty good.
                <br><br>
                But you have no time to lose. SKYNET, a rouge AI, is going to kill your mother. Fortunately, you are an expert hacker and is determined to save your mom from certain death. You need to hack into SKYNET's mainframe and disable their algorithms. You slip on your NES Powerglove. The fate of this world rests on your Commodore 64.
                <br><br>
                This is a game I made for my AP Computer Science Principles class in my junior year of high school. It's completely written in Python3 and while the game has some minor bugs, it is fully playable.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is intended to be played on a fullscreen terminal. Synthwave music is required for the full immersive experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                EDIT: as of 2019-12-30, the game no longer works on my computer. There seems to be an issue with the pythondialog module. I have tried everything to get my game working again to no avail.
