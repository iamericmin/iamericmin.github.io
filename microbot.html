            <p>POCKET-SIZED ROBOT</p>
            <a>
                In this project, I aim to clone myself. Now, I know to some of you that this might seem overly ambitious. But this project will be really easy, because all I do is do absolutely nothing and die. My clone, in the form of a pocket-sized robot, will do just that. In fact, it will do a bit more, since I am thinking of adding IR sensors for autonomous drive.

                Right now, I'm thinking of using Nordic's nRF52832 SoC as the brains of my clone. It has a powerful ARM Cortex-M4 processor and a BLE radio for wireless control. Two vibration motors on either side of my clone will push it forward. This will also allow the robot to tank-turn. LEDs will serve as headlights and indicator lights for various modes. Two buttons will serve as a crude input method for configuring the robot, say switching between drive modes. An expansion header will provide power, a full-duplex serial port, and four ADCs. The motors, each with its own FET, will be powered by a lipo battery. The nRF52832 SoC and LEDs will be powered by a CR2032 coin cell.
