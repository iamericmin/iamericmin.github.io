            <p>THE NINTENDO AESTHETIC</p>
            <a>
                Recently , while hunting for design inspirations for the Time Machine Mk. ]|[, I realized how visually appealing Nintendo's designs are. Take a look at these Game and Watches from the '80s.

                I love the use colors on each of the handhelds. There's each a warm and cool color on every one of the games. Look at <i>Pinball</i>, for example. I think it's the best-designed Game and Watch and I love the black/orange/blue color scheme on the top as well as the red and white stripes on the inside. It's minimal while also being funky and fun, just the way a pinball machine should be.

                <br>
                Let's now look at the Famicom, my favorite console of all time. It seems to be obscured by the NES a lot despite the fact that the Famicom was actually released 2 eyars earlier. It is extremely different from the NES, from the size to the colors. While the NES is gray and black with a futuristic vibe, the Famicom, on the other hand, is red and white and almost half the size of the NES. The <i>FAMILY COMPUTER</i> branding on the front is the icing on the cake.

                <p style="clear: both;"></p>
                <br>
                
                The cartridges for the Famicom is in my opinion extremely well designed, especially the boxes. The artwork is colorful and funky like a comic book, and it gives the boxes a cute charm that makes them worth saving along with the games. The cartridges on the left are all launch titles for the Famicom, and I really dig the shared pulse design. It's minimal but fun. Another thing I love about the cartridges is how they are all colored differently unlike NES cartridges which are all grey. I also favor the size and shape of Famicom cartridges over NES cartridges, which are unneccesarily big.<br>

                <br>
                The games themselves are no exception either. This is <i>Pinball</i>, <i>Mario Bros</i>, and <i>Ice Climber</i>, all first-party launch titles for the Famicom. Just like the console and cartridges, all the games use bright colors like pink or green but does a good job of blending them along with dark colors like black and brown to make them pop but not get in the way of the visuals.
