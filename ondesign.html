            <a>
                It is currently spring break of my high school senior year and Coronavirus has given me an additional week of spring break. Now, this may sound nice but I was actually touring colleges and since I don't live in the US, I'm basically homeless for another week. So, I'm passing my time writing another article. This one's on how I design my stuff.
                <br><br>
                When starting any PCB, I think of a physical shape first and try to work my circuit into it. My designs are inspired by my various interests, such as cars, science fiction, or vintage tech.
                <br><br>
                I just realized I need to finish Time Machine 5 to fully write this article so I guess this write-up won't stay finished for a while, oops!
