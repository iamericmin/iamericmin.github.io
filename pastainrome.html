                "I love you."
                <br><br>
                To most people, these magical three words spread warmth and joy throughout their body like Nutella on toast, no matter how often they've heard it before. Usually, those words are greeted back with a smile or an "I love you too." It's no different for me, but I can never get that nagging whisper out from the back of my mind.
                <br><br>
                <i>"That's a lie."</i>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                I like to think of my life as a series of hoops. My first major "hoop" was overcoming social anxiety in high school. When I finally emerged as a more confident and outgoing extrovert, I thought I had life all figured out. I felt as if I held the key to all the secrets in the universe. For the next couple months, I was ridiculously proud of myself for working towards becoming a better me. So of course, I walked into college all cocky and smug, only to be met with another hoop.
                <br><br>
                What was it called? Pasta in Rome?
                <br><br>
                Ah, yes. Imposter syndrome.
                <br><br>
                I honestly have no idea how it started, but I know for sure it was with me ever since I figured out object permanance. I just never knew its name. There's a side of me that percieves everything about me as fake, but not really on my abilities, but rather my relationships and the perceptions of those around me. I rarely take compliments to heart, because I rarely think they are true. Even when I'm around my friends and having a fun time, there's a slice of myself nagging me that my friends would indifferent without me. When people show interest in me, I often think it's only because they are being polite, and not out of genuine love or respect. Sometimes, I feel like my usual confident, extroverted self is merely a facade to keep hidden a slice of myself that I hate. And when those feelings come crashing in like a tsunami, I feel very lonely. And my worst fear is being alone.
                <br><br>
                Of course, I don't always suffer from these thoughts. And when I do, I think back to all my good memories from years past and keep telling myself that the pasta is a lie. After all, people can only gauge things around them with their own little yardstick. Realizing that my distorted perception of myself is not necessarily how others think of me, is I think the crucial first step in clearing my hoop.
