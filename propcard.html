            <p>PROPELLER-SAMD21G SoM</p>

                <h3>2019-12-30</h3>
                I love the Propeller. I love ARM micros. I don't know FPGA design yet, so I decided to just make a small board with both the Parallax Propeller and the Atmel SAMD21G!
                <br><br>
                This project aims to create a dev kit using the Atmel SAMD21G and the Parallax Propeller. The Propeller will be a peripheral chip connected to the SAMD21G via a UART bridge. I want the PCB to be in a credit-card size form factor or smaller. Every pin on both microcontrollers will be broken out into 1.27mm pitch female headers. A USB-C port will provide regulated power and USB communication for the SAM.
                <br><br>
                I chose the SAM and propeller for a few reasons. The SAM runs at 48mHz and features PWM on almost all of its IO pins, which makes it a solid choice for many projects. If I remember correctly, the Propeller features PWM on all of its pins, and its custom octa-core architecture enables easy multi-tasking. It also runs at 80mHz, useful for driving LEDs or crunching numbers. I intend the SAM to act as the main processor and the Propeller to be a peripheral chip customizable by the user to be anything from a simple IO expander to a video generator.
                <br><br>
                This is how I intend the firmware to be: I will make a set of commands that the SAM can send to the Propeller through UART. Tasks like video generation or starting/stopping cogs will be commanded by the SAM. The Propeller will always be listening for these commands and do as the SAM says.
