                Wanted Propeller Professional Development Board.
                <br><br>
                Didn't have Propeller Professional  Development Board.
                <br><br>
                Propeller Professional Development Board was discontinued.
                <br><br>
                Made my own Propeller Professional Development Board.

                The "Alphanumeric photon emitters" on the top-right corner of the board is actually an Adafruit I2C 14-segment featherwing. I decided to use a featherwing instead of multiplexing LEDs to save pins and assembly time. On the far right I put some JST-PH connectors. They were meant to be I2C connectors but in the schematic they aren't connected to any signals :)
                <br><br>
                I believe the quote for this board was around a grand for a batch of ten PCBs. That made me lose any hopes of making it a reality. Luckily, after many days of rooting around the internet, I finally found a used Propeller Pro Dev Board for sale. I instantly bought it and walked my first steps with the Parallax Propeller. I'll leave you with the schematic for the Giga Workbench!
