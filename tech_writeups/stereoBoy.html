                It is rare for someone to be offered a chance to pursue their wildest dreams. For someone to be given a chance to do something he loves so intensely that he can't possibly imagine doing anything else for a living, is quite the chance of a lifetime. I was given this chance, almost blank-check style, my first semester of senior year at Purdue University. ECE49595SD, Senior Design Semester 1. Of course, I took this opportunity to realize a personal dream I've had for quite a while: a portable stero system.
