          <a>
            By the end of my first year of college, it was my time to serve in the South Korean army. A requirement for all South Korean males above the age of 18, it was simply a duty I had to fulfill, whether I wanted to or not.
            <br><br>
            For 545 days, I had to live away from everyone and everything I knew in a completely foreign environment, often surrounded by people whose sole purpose seemed to be to inflict pain and misery to those underneath them, including me. I was often called ridiculous nicknames and forced to make a fool of myself in front of people who were constantly intoxicated in their power trip simply for the fact that they entered service three months before I did. For 18 months, I was usually no more than just a plaything for my superiors to toy around with whenever they were bored. Sometimes, I cried quietly alone in one of the bathroom stalls. It was a tough 545 days, but fortunately I was able to find great solace in doing what I loved the most: designing electronics.
            <br><br>
            As much as I loved it, designing Time Machine Mk. 8 was an exercise in extreme frustration. While I had access to a computer lab, the computers all booted into RAM, meaning all installed programs, online accounts, and saved work disappeared on shutdown. I had to use Google Drive to save any work, but the computers would very often freeze and random without any warnings whatsoever, throwing away hours of my work and requiring me to go through the tedious process of installing everything all over again. Due to the nature of life in the army, I wasn't able to work on TM8 during the weekdays, and I only had a handful of hours during the weekends. So every Sunday, I printed my schematics and PCB layouts, and studied them during the week whenever I had time. I circled any errors and mistakes with a red pen and wrote down plans for fixes on my little red notebook. Every weekend, I brought my notes to the computer lab to work. Printing my work was a complete nightmare by itself.
            <br><br>
            The more I worked on TM8, the greater my dedication became. The computers (and especially the printer) often brought my patience to its absolute limits, but it was all I had. I often starved myself to save money for parts, and instead quenched my hunger with unhealthy amounts of instant coffee. I didn't care about the crappy computers and nerve-wracking lockups, as long as I made progress. During my last six months of service, I spent pretty much every single weekend in the computer lab working on TM8.
            <br><br>
            TM8 is not impressive at all from an engineering perspective. It's just a simple microcontroller board with some sensors, and it took really long to make. But it's the process and my undying passion and love for what I do, that makes it so incredibly special, at least to me. It gave me something to focus on when my life was at its hardest, and gives me immense confidence for whatever lies ahead. I know no matter where I am, as long as I give it my all, just like I did so with creating Time Machine Mk. 8, everything will be alright.
