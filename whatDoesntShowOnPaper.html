              It's like the wind, some say.
              <br><br>
              Or gravity.
              <br><br>
              You can't see it, but you know it's there.
              <br><br>
              You can't find its button on the dash. Or its chapter in the owner's manual.
              <br><br>
              We have no drawings of it. We don't know how much it weighs. Can't time it on the track.
              <br><br>
              Ask ten of our engineers about it, and get ten different answers.
              <br><br>
              But there's no debate about its existence.
              <br><br>
              After just one day behind the wheel, it's the most valuable part of the car.
              <br><br>
              The irreplacable component.
              <br><br>
              The thing you love more and more with every passing mile. The thing you instantly miss in any other car.
              <br><br>
              <br><br>
              <b>The soul.</b>
              <br><br><br><br>
              This is from a commercial for the Porsche Taycan. It also shows what I consider to be the most important quality in any engineering product. The soul.
              <br><br>
              People often talk about soul when talking about cars. A car's soul communicates through its steering, handling, sound, and all the other kinds of feedback to the driver. People often say a car has soul when it is communicative and offers something unique. They wax lyrical about cars like the Mazda Miata, where its frankly pathetic performance figures are completely outshone by its playful charm and soul. On the other hand, people often say a car is soulless when it is bland and follows the norm without anything special to offer. The new 2024 C63 AMG is the perfect example; it makes 671 horsepower with an incredibly complex hybrid system derived from Formula One, yet journalists rant on about its excessive weight, subpar chassis, and overcomplicated interface. The Miata simply distills and conveys the joy of driving directly to the driver, whereas the C63 manufactures and synthesizes it in its own weird, discombobulated way through layers of overly complicated technology and bloat. While on paper, the C63 decimates the Miata in every metric, the latter fails miserably in real life, as it simply lacks the soul to do so. Personally, I think the Ferrari F8 tributo, SF90 Stradale, and almost all of McLaren's recent supercars also fall into the "soulless" category.
              <br><br>
              Porsche is right. What doesn't show on paper is the most important quality of a car.
              <br><br>
              To me, this idea extends far beyond cars. The soul of an engineering product, whether it's a car, an app, or a circuit board, is breathed into by those who create it, specifically by these three qualities: confidence, simplicity, and attention to detail. These three qualities of an engineer are directly transferred to his or her creations, and that is what gives a product <b>soul</b>.
              <br><br>
              <h1>CONFIDENCE</h1>
              <h2>>_ DO NOT TRY TO BE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT</h2>
              purpose and consistency
              <h1>SIMPLICITY</h1>
              <h2>>_ EVERYTHING IT NEEDS AND NOTHING IT DOES NOT</h2>
              "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity" - Terry Davis
              <h1>ATTENTION TO DETAIL</h1>
              <h2></h2>
              It needs to be honest. Should not try to be something it's not.
              It needs to be reliable.
              It needs to have personality.
              It needs to be intuitive.
